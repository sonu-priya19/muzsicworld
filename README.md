# musizona-music-app
I have made a music player application (Musizona) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses simple HTML and CSS for the front-end part (for displaying web pages). All the
functionalities (playing and pause the music file, toggling and rendering the music files, buttons etc.) are added with the help of Javascript. The script is loaded into
the HTML files and then web page functions according to the userâ€™s input. All the files are stored in the local machine as of now. Whenever the user plays a certain
song, the JS files requests the file from the source and plays it. JavaScript can handle audio file using Audio method.
Kindly leave suggestions at E-mail for improvement.
